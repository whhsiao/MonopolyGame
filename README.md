# MonopolyGame
This repo discussed some programs for solving a monopoly game problem and their extensions
## Introduction:
Some days ago I ran into the following post on reddit referring to a simplified version of monopoly game.
<https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/cr1g3y/the_game_of_monopoly_is_played_on_a_square_board/>

It reminds of some probability questions that may possibly appear in quantitative finance interviews. I was quite interested in this problem and therefore in this repo I will present two versions of numerical solutions, one with Monte Carlo simulation, the other utilizing Markov Chain evolution.
## Statement of the Problem:
The statement of the problem goes as follows.

*The game of monopoly is played on a square board with 10 spaces per side (so 40 in total). A player starts at the space marked "go" and on each turn rolls two sided dice, advancing forward a number of spaces equal to the sum of the two numbers that lands face up. (if a player rolls a sum that would normally cause them to advance past the 40th square, they will instead loop around, so if a player landed on a hypothetical 44th square, they will instead go to the 4th square on the board). Let P be the probability that a player after they "loop around" the board 10 times, lands on the space "Boardwalk" (the 40th square) before they "loop around" the board an eleventh time. Which integer is closest to the value 20P?*
