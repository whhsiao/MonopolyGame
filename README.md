# MonopolyGame
This repo discussed some programs for solving a monopoly game problem and their extensions
## Introduction
Some days ago I ran into the following post on reddit referring to a simplified version of monopoly game.
<https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/cr1g3y/the_game_of_monopoly_is_played_on_a_square_board/>
It reminds of some probability questions that may possibly appear in quantitative finance interviews. I was quite interested in this problem and therefore in this repo I will present two versions of numerical solutions, one with Monte Carlo simulation, the other utilizing Markov Chain evolution.
## Statement of the Problem
-Monte Carlo Simulation
-Markov Chain Evolution
